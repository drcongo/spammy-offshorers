Spammy Off-Shorers
==================

This is a list of off shore development companies who have a tendency to send out scattergun spam to digital agencies, in a format for dropping into your Gmail filters.

If you’re anything like me you probably get several unsolicited emails per day from companies in other countries asking if you would like your "androids deveeloped by your teem of axperts" or your "WordPress sights built from photoshops". Given the success of the [Spammy Recruiters](https://github.com/drcongo/spammy-recruiters) project, this feels like the sensible way to deal with them.

So let’s keep a collaborative list of the companies that spam us in a format ready for dropping into a Gmail filter. Let’s do it on GitHub so that anyone can add to it via pull requests, or fork it to create their own. Let’s make it impossible for these people to actually get through to any of us.

If you do get involved, please have a look at the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/drcongo/spammy-offshorers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md "contributing guidelines"). Thanks.

## Protip ##

Install the Canned Response plugin from Google Labs (it's in `Settings --> Labs --> Canned Responses`: Enable it, then scroll to the bottom of the page and save your changes), create a new filter in your Gmail / Google Apps, paste this list into the `From` field, and set Gmail to automatically reply with something like this:

    Hi.

    It looks like you're an off-shore development company and you've sent me an
    unsolicited email.
    This is an automated response to let you know that it has been flagged as
    spam and deleted without me ever seeing it.

    The same thing will happen to further emails you send me. If this is a 
    mistake and you are actually someone I work with then you'll have my mobile
    number, give me a call to let me know.

    If you're wondering what this is all about, have a look here:

Make sure to have the filter also flag it as spam and delete it.
